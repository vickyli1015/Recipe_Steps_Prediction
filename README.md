# Spice Up Your Models: Decoding Recipe Step Predictions
Predicting the Number of Steps in a Recipe Using Models
by Vicky Li: <yil164@ucsd.edu>

Our exploratory data analysis on this dataset can be found [here](https://vickyli1015.github.io/Recipes-Rating-Analysis/)

## Framing the Problem

### Prediction problem of interest: 

Predict the **number of steps in recipes** using features from the combined data frame containing recipes and ratings.

Since number of steps is a quantitative variable, this is a **regression problem**. I'm going to use a **regression model** to predict it, i.e., the ***n_steps* column** specifically. I chose it for personal reasons. I am a lazy person and I don't want to spend so much time on cooking/preparing for cooking, so I am so curious about what characteristics of a recipe may contribute to number of steps involved!

For this question, I am going to use **RMSE** as the metric to evaluate the model. It comes with the **same unit of the response variable (n_steps)**, making it easier to interpret with context. For example, if RMSE = 3, that means the **average magnitude of the residuals**, i.e, the mean error that this model has for predicting the number of steps involved is around 3 **steps**! Also, it is useful since we want to prioritize reducing larger deviations, which is also why I prefer RMSE more than metrics like R-sqaured. Since our model is not a classifier, metrics like F1-score and precision does not work here.

## Baseline Model

Given the dataset containing recipe and ratings information as shown above:

#exploring some relationship (if any) between features and the response variable (n_steps)
min_steps = px.scatter(recipes, x = 'minutes', y = 'n_steps', rang


I am going to start off by predict the number of steps (n_steps) in a recipe using **minutes (minutes)** and the **number of ingredients (n_ingredients)** of the recipe. In this case, I am going to use a **linear regression model** to get started. Linear regression model tries to capture the relationship between features and the response variable by **fitting a linear line** through the data points. Both features are quantitative, and I will leave them as-is (though I still use a FunctionTransformer to keep them as-is) when training the pipeline model to. However, this should not affect the model’s natural ability to predict.
